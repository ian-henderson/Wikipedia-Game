# Wikipedia-Game
The `wikipedia_game(root, target)` function uses a non-recursive breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between two Wikipedia pages. The `root` and `target` arguments must be the exact titles of the desired pages. 

## Setup
1. Set up a Python virtual environment with `virtualenv`.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
